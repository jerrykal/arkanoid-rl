# Arkanoid RL

An RL agent that interacts with the Arkanoid game environment maintained by [PAIA](https://github.com/PAIA-Playful-AI-Arena)

## Note

This is the first homework assignment of 
[INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS APPLICATION TO GAMING](https://class-qry.acad.ncku.edu.tw/syllabus/online_display.php?syear=0111&sem=2&co_no=F723300&class_code=)
course from NCKU. I'll be pushing my final implementation once the homework deadline's passed
